# Usage Examples in Nuxt Application

**English** | [日本語](./README.ja.md)

This example shows how to use Viewport Extra in a [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) application.

## Notes

- When testing with developer tools of desktop browsers, mobile device simulation must be enabled and the viewport must be set to the desired size before navigating to a page that uses Viewport Extra. If the order is reversed, the browser may ignore the `initial-scale` setting of the `<meta name="viewport">` element. This behavior is specific to simulation in developer tools and does not occur in actual mobile browsers.
